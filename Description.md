# 2048Game
A project to show 2048 game. The rule of this game is as follows - 
two numbers would be given at two random tiles in a 4x4 grid,
and the numbers can merge into one by moving left, right, up or down. If
any tile of the grid contains the number 2048, the game is over. This game can be 
played either in single-player or multi-player modes. In either ways, whoever gets the 
number 2048 in his turn, is the winner of this game.
