# 2048Game
A project to show 2048 game. The rule of this game is as follows -
two numbers would be given at two random tiles of a 4x4 grid, and the numbers can
be merged into one by moving left, right, up or down. If any tile of the grid contains
the number 2048, the game is over. This game can be played either in single-player or multi-player modes
(although, I haven't made the required settings in my code to show to the user whether he wants to play in
single-player or multi-player mode xD). In either ways, whoever gets the number 2048 in his turn wins the game.
